## Hi, I'm Clarisse 👋🏼👩🏻‍💻

I am currently a first-year student at La Plateforme school. So far, I have started studying HTML and CSS, as well as hardware emulation and virtualization with VMware Workstation, Windows 11, and Debian. I have discovered a passion for web development, but I am looking forward to exploring AI.

‣ 🔭 I'm currently working on my Github Profile.

‣ 🌱 I'm currently learning on Python.
